ItemDAO:
batch saving is working if "cascade = CascadeType.ALL" is only in Item_v1
if it's in both Invoice_v1 and Item_v1 than saving is as follows:
1) item0 is saved (invoice id is null)
2) invoice is saved
3) item1 is saved (invoice id is NOT null)
4) item2 is saved
5) item3 is saved
6) invoice triggers saving of item1 (that was saved) that's why
unique index (invoice id and order number) is broken

if "cascade = CascadeType.ALL" is in both Invoice_v1 and Item_v1 than
it is enough to save item0 and invoice with other items will be saved:
//            session.save(item_v1_list.get(0));
